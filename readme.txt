A WordPress plugin for making either single score or multiple break down reviews on posts and/or pages.

== Description ==

Critique is a simple review plugin that can add single or multi sectioned reviews to either pages and/or posts. After installation and initial setup a new post meta box, "Critique Review Score", is added to the right of the post and/or page edit screens depending on your settings. If you do not see the metabox go to your screen options and make sure it is enabled. When posting, simply fill out the form using either the inputs or by clicking the score line, once you save the posting your critique score(s) will be saved and displayed on the front end as well. If you leave a section blank it will not be displayed on the front end nor will it be used to calculate the overall average score.

The front end display has numerous classes added to various elements and should be easy to adjust to match your specific sites theme. The default styles are basic and may work well with your existing theme. 

_Note: If in the future you change your scale it will not retroactively effect your old critiques, so if for the first year you were using a 5 star system, then switch to a # out of 100 system, the 5 star reviews will be grandfathered in._

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `critique` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Active the plugin.
3. Go to the new "Critique Setting" page and review/adjust the settings as desired.

The settings page has notes on their functions and should be self explanatory, but here are the highlights.

- **Active Post Types** determines where the critique metabox is displayed, either in posts and/or pages as desired.

- **Display Options** controls what is shown in a multi-item page (like the blog homepage). You have the options of displaying the entire review, just the overall, or nothing (by leaving both boxes unchecked).

- **Review Settings** set what the review scale you want to use it and, if desired, allows you to review based on multiple sections. If you are using multiple review sections you can also enable an automatically calculated "Overall Average" that will appear at the bottom of the section list when displayed on site.
